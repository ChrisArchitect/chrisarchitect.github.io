title: "Blue Is the Color, Hyperlinking Is the Game"

### A follow-up on a recent post from the Mozilla blog, [Why are hyperlinks blue?](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/deep-dives/why-are-hyperlinks-blue/)

While intrigued like many about the age-old design origins of a core part of the web, links, I was left wanting. It's not that it wasn't a good idea for a 'deep dive' ([although not like it hasn't been covered](https://css-tricks.com/chapter-2-browsers/)): a chance to review the various intricacies of early web, the legends of Tim Berners-Lee, and the inevitable version histories of things like Mosaic that come with this kind of technical angle. However, the post never really answered it's own question - but rather dwelled on release history beyond the original period and a lot of speculation that it might have been random, based on capabilities or legibility, or presenting "I think it might have been" as a conclusion. Like I said, left a reader like me wanting more of answer.

#### Here's a few helpful things I dug up with the help of searches and some discussions that came out of the post on HN etc.

### From the horse's mouth

The horse being TBL himself, who once pondered the answer to this very question and it's archived in a [W3.org FAQ on him](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#etc):

>  There is no reason why one should use color, or blue, to signify links: it is just a default. ... Blue came in as browsers went color - I don't remember which was the first to use blue. ... My guess is that blue is the darkest color and so threatens the legibility least.

### Look to the Hypertext

When talking about early and pre-web history, one should never discount the importance of Hypertext. It's significant influence over what would materialize as Berners-Lee's vision for the World Wide Web goes beyond just keeping use of the word *hyper* popular at the time but being part of foundational work for years and years before Tim's 1989 proposal.

In fact the Mozilla blog post touches on a specific Hypertext-related project called HyperTIES in its timeline around 1983, but doesn't really delve into what was going on there with Hypertext.
