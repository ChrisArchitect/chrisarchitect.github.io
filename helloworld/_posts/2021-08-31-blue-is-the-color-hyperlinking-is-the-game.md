title: "Blue Is the Color, Hyperlinking Is the Game"
---
<!-- 
Left wanting after that recent blog that asked Why are hyperlinks blue? Couple things:
From the horse's mouth–
Tim Berners-Lee himself in a Press FAQ: "…it is just a default… My guess is that blue is the darkest color and so threatens the legibility least."

Look to the Hypertext–
Ben Shneiderman who worked on the HyperTIES interactive system did studies on visual interface patterns leading up to 1987 including highlighted links, choosing blue which TBL then was influenced by later.

### A follow-up on a recent post from the Mozilla blog, [Why are hyperlinks blue?](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/deep-dives/why-are-hyperlinks-blue/)

While intrigued like many about the age-old design origins of a core part of the web, links, I was left wanting. It's not that it wasn't a good idea for a 'deep dive' ([although not like it hasn't been covered](https://css-tricks.com/chapter-2-browsers/)): a chance to review the various intricacies of early web, the legend of Tim Berners-Lee, and the inevitable version histories of browsers like Mosaic and its successors that come with this kind of technical angle. However, the post never really answered it's own question but rather dwelled on release history beyond the original period and a lot of speculation that it might have been random, based on capabilities or legibility, or presenting personal theories as a conclusion. Like I said, left a reader like me wanting more of answer.

#### Here's two helpful things I dug up with some searches and further reading:

## From the horse's mouth

The horse being TBL himself, who once pondered the answer to this very question. It's archived in a W3C FAQ on him:

>  There is no reason why one should use color, or blue, to signify links: it is just a default. … Blue came in as browsers went color - I don't remember which was the first to use blue. … **My guess is that blue is the darkest color and so threatens the legibility least.**[^1]

## The HyperTIES That Bind

When talking about early and pre-web history, one should never discount the importance of Hypertext. It's significant influence over what would materialize as Berners-Lee's vision for the World Wide Web goes beyond just keeping use of the word *hyper* popular at the time but being part of foundational work for years *before* Tim's 1989 proposal.

In fact the Mozilla blog post touches on a specific Hypertext-related project called HyperTIES in its timeline around 1983 and following that development branch is where we will find some more answers.

As part of the Hypertext research going on [at UMD](https://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/) by Ben Shneiderman and friends, HyperTIES started as *The Interactive Encyclopedia Systems* and is where the idea of highlighted links in text was birthed. Development continued for many years as they tried to build something commercial from the interactive encyclopedia idea. Schneiderman was focused on the visual interface of links in paragraphs of text and reported on developments at the 1987 Hypertext conference. The following year in 1988 the HyperTIES system was used as the delivery system on a disk of papers called Hypertext on Hypertext for an issue of *Communications of the ACM*, where a certain Tim Berners-Lee gained some inspiration. 

Shneiderman tells how his students did studies on various UI elements leading up to 1987:

> My students conducted more than a dozen experiments (unpublished) on different ways of highlighting and selection using current screens, e.g. green screens only permitted, bold, underscore, blinking, and I think italic(?). When we had a color screen we tried different color highlighted links. While red made the links easier to spot, user comprehension and recollection of the content declined. **We chose the light blue, which Tim adopted.**[^2]

So there you have a significant answer, folks. More than why developers of browsers may have maintained it over time or even in those early 90s days, the source of the initial inspiration is the place to land on. The work of the HyperTIES team developing their Hypertext linking concepts through UI design research (which formulated conclusions about legibility) coupled with the distribution reach their system had thanks to the 1988 ACM makes the Hypertext era a major key to this links question. It being in the mix while Tim Berners-Lee took things to the next level, and also general color screen technological advancements that happened over the next few years pretty much set the hyperlinking game on its blue course into the future.
